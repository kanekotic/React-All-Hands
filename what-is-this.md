# React, what is that?

Lets start this clear. React by itself is  just a **rendering framework, **with a **virtual DOM** that you can use to generate visualizations. This is all that react provides out of the box.

Is this good or bad?, personally its neither. It makes it a very un-opinionated framework, where you can then extend with several tools that have been generated around it to manage different types of complexities. 

This simplification makes it difference from Angular, that is very opinionated on how to do things, providing a dependency injection framework, bindings to multiple extention concepts like directives, etc.
